        <meta name="description" content="Most people don&#x27;t dream of being a database administrator when they grow up. I&#x27;ve worked with databases for over 25 years because I love them so much, but I&#x27;m aware that most people don&#x27;t feel the same way! Most of the developers I know just want the database to quietly do its thing in the background so they can concentrate on coding. Which seems like a reasonable request.

But the world of databases is changing. The traditional DBA role is becoming less common, and developers are increasingly expected to manage their own databases. Let&#x27;s talk about how you, as a developer, can navigate this new reality, and what you actually need to know about databases.
