DESCRIPTION:Most people don't dream of being a database administrator when 
 they grow up. I've worked with databases for over 25 years because I love 
 them so much\, but I'm aware that most people don't feel the same way! Mos
 t of the developers I know just want the database to quietly do its thing 
 in the background so they can concentrate on coding. Which seems like a re
 asonable request.\n\nBut the world of databases is changing. The tradition
 al DBA role is becoming less common\, and developers are increasingly expe
 cted to manage their own databases. Let's talk about how you\, as a develo
 per\, can navigate this new reality\, and what you actually need to know a
 bout databases.\n\nWho knows - maybe\, along the way\, I can even convince
  you to love databases just a little bit!
