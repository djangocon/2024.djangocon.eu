We will dive into what GraphQL is, how it compares to traditional RESTful APIs, and what makes Strawberry stand out from other Python GraphQL libraries.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenges in GraphQL API development is the *N+1* problem, where queries can become exponentially slow as more data is requested. We will discuss how data loaders can help solve this problem, and go in-depth on how to use them in Strawberry. In this topic we will also cover how the Strawberry Django integration leverages query introspection and user defined hints to automatically call `.only(\u2026)`/`.select_related(\u2026)`/`.prefetch_related(\u2026)` on querysets, making your queries more efficient and avoiding common pitfalls. This is especially important in high-traffic, production environments where performance is critical.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will showcase some of the benefits of using Strawberry and Django together, including a type-safe approach to API development and streamlined code maintenance.

In this talk, we will look at the most common issues with SQLite and how to mitigate them.\r\n\r\nWe will look at issues like database lock errors, timeouts, concurrent reads and writes, and slow performance and show how to work around some of these limitations. We will also show how to manage backups, replicas, and point-in-time recovery, which is necessary for many production applications.\r\n\r\nWe will look at the issues I had with SQLite on my side projects (fedidevs.com), how I overcame them, and how people use SQLite outside of the Django/Python community. We will also look at benchmarks to see how SQLite compares to PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\nWe will also cover some recent patches merged into Django that make it much easier to configure SQLite for web application use cases, starting with Django 5.1.\r\n\r\nThe talk's goal is not to convince you that your next application should use SQLite in production but to help you understand the trade-offs and make a good decision for your specific use case.\r\n\r\nVideo: https://youtu.be/GTDYwEXv-sE", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "9865c82b-8b21-5583-9172-a890e87572a4", "id": 693, "code": "DGGFQB", "public_name": "An\u017ee", "avatar": "https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/media/avatars/12b7e40ed1ebd4846746004c77020183_1Oby6lU.jpg", "biography": "I enjoy writing Python code and surfing waves \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\r\n\r\nSide Projects:\r\n\ud83d\udcbb https://github.com/anze3db/django-tui a TUI for all your Django commands\r\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb https://fedidevs.com find awesome devs across the fediverse\r\n\ud83e\uddea https://flakytest.dev tame your test suite flakiness", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2024/talk/LJBJ7Q/", "id": 904, "guid": "251dbd0e-662c-5613-9747-62d3a145f333", "date": "2024-06-07T11:15:00+02:00", "start": "11:15", "logo": "https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/media/djangocon-europe-2024/submissions/LJBJ7Q/django-ninja-crud-with-background_C05F1pa.png", "duration": "00:30", "room": "Auditorium", "slug": "djangocon-europe-2024-904-modernizing-crud-operations-in-django-with-a-declarative-interface-using-django-ninja-crud", "title": "Modernizing CRUD Operations in Django with a Declarative Interface using Django Ninja CRUD", "subtitle": "", "track": null, "type": "Talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Explore the transformative approach to CRUD operations in Django apps, emphasizing a declarative interface for streamlined API development and testing.

And in most business cases, it's required. But is it fun? Is it DRY? Where do my variables for my base template go? Does it feel like reinventing the wheel when implementing some level of abstraction? And how the heck am I supposed to write a proper unit test? Well, in most cases, most of the Djangonauts I know including myself would go for a \"no\" or at least \u201cdunno\u201d.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I implemented \"django-pony-express\" to tackle those problems. Like existing djangoesque patterns and therefore easy to grasp, you'll define your emails in a neat class instead of a bunch of similar looking functions. The presented approach will take care of having duplicated templates for the plain-text and HTML parts, variables needed for your base template and much more. \r\nBut the best part: It ships with a test suite which transforms the Django test mailbox to a QuerySet-like object which can be worked with without having to have a diploma. Furthermore, it provides a best-practice to unit-test your emails to finally enable every developer in the team to test even those parts of your code.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to present the package \u201cdjango-pony-express\u201d which delivers a class-based abstraction layer like the Django Class-based views.\r\n\r\nEmails are a crucial part of many business applications. Having worked on many (>15) different projects in various industry sectors over the last 11 years, I realised that implementing clean, reusable code for your emails is always a challenge.
