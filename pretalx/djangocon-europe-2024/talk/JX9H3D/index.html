                <section class="description">
                    <p>"I photograph to find out what something will look like photographed", said the great photographer Garry Winogrand. The genius of his work lies in his phenomenal powers of <em>attention</em>, his ability to see. <em>Seeing</em> is a deliberate act.</p>
<p>What do programmers "see"? How well do we do it? And are we so full of intention that we fail to pay attention? </p>
<p>I want to pursue this question, with the aid of philosophers, poets and photography, and I want to light up a potential dimension in programming that I haven't seen explored. For example: why is it that a story or photograph can be <em>about</em> something, but we never hear of a computer programme that is <em>about</em> something? Is it not possible? Or have we just missed it? We're all familiar with love poems and love songs - could a love program exist? What would it look like?</p>
<p>I think we can answer all those questions in interesting ways, that connect our understanding and appreciation of the world and our arts with programming. I think that they can suggest new opportunities and ideas to us. And, I think that it can make a difference to us, even as practically-minded Django programmers doing practical work.</p>
