DESCRIPTION:We're programmers\, and we're full of *intention*\, programming
  our will in symbols\, to be executed by machines. From automated testing 
 to our agile workflows\, the values of our discipline are aligned around i
 ntention. For us\, success means successfully bringing about what we *inte
 nded*. \n\nBut\, in all this vigorous\, forward-looking intention\, I thin
 k we overlook another kind of meaning\, that is to be found in *attention*
 . I think that by looking at other arts and disciplines we can discover so
 mething new that we can bring to programming\, to enrich it and make it de
 eper and more fulfilling - and possibly even better.
