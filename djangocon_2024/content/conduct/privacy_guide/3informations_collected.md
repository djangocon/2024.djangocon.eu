The data subject will provide their consent by confirming several options, appropriate for each case, by selecting different technical parameters and completing various fields, which demonstrate the data subject’s positive act and unmistakable willingness to provide personal data. 

The DjangoCon Europe 2024 organizers will endeavor to observe the principles of proportionality and necessity by performing a case-by-case analysis, adjusting the need for processing personal data when providing different services. In some cases, only a name and e-mail will be requested. In other cases, like a proposal speaker, more information needs to be collected. We don’t process sensitive data.
