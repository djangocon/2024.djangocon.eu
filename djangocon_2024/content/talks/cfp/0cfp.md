This page contains all information regarding the proposal process for DjangoCon Europe – we will update it regularly as new information becomes available.

It's a new year. What better way to start it than submitting your talk or workshop for **DjangoCon Europe 2024**, in beautiful **Vigo, Spain?**

The **Call for Proposals (CFP)** is open now, and will be until 23:59 (UTC) on February 29th. That's two whole months, but you don't have to leave it to the last minute:

[DjangoCon Europe 2024, Vigo CFP](https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2024/cfp)

We're looking for a range of talks on technical and non-technical topics. We're looking for talks accessible to skill all levels, and we're looking for submissions from new and seasoned speakers.

If you're asking, can I do this? The answer is yes. If you've got a topic that interest you, then it interests us.

If you've got half an idea, or aren't sure in any way, and want to chat, you can jump on the DjangoCon Europe Slack, and find us there.

Don't be shy, we want to hear from you!
