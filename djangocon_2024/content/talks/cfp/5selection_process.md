Reviewing the talks and tutorials submitted to a conference can be a daunting task – there is much to consider, and usually there are more great submissions than there are slots available in the conference schedule.

We’d like to make our reviewing process and guidelines transparent to every submitter and attendee, both to show you what will await you during the conference as an attendee, and to help you understand our decisions regarding your submissions as a submitter.

Moreover, we might **prioritize speakers from an under-represented or marginalised group in order to increase the social impact of the conference**.


We will document our selection process on this website and announce it via [X](https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope) (formerly known as Twitter) @DjangoConEurope, Slack djangoconeurope.slack.com , or LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/company/djangocon-europe/ .
