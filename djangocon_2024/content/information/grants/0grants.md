**DjangoCon Europe 2024 offers grants so that those who might otherwise not be able to attend won't hesitate to participate.** Some expenses for the conference attendance (which could include travel, hotel, registration, etc) will be covered for opportunity grant recipients.

We actively encourage you to apply for an opportunity grant. While we wish we could give grants to everyone who applies, we do not have the funds to do that. Our goal is to maximize the impact our grant program has, within the limited funds we have.

We try to do this in a number of ways:

- Conferences are a meeting place for developers from all around the globe. Therefore, the selection process is designed to benefit people that we believe will make a difference, particularly speakers and tutorial presenters.
- Additionally, the selection process attempts to promote a more diverse DjangoCon Europe. While encouraging diversity takes many forms, we're happy to use the opportunity grant program as a very direct method of supporting diversity within the Python community. In particular, our grant program prioritizes those who belong to under-represented or marginalized groups in our industry, as attending our event is likely to be more difficult and financially onerous for them.
- When prioritizing grant applications, we try to get a feel for how much impact this grant will have on the applicant and the wider community and country, compared to others. In this, we consider things like involvement in a local community, social impact of the applicant's activities, and how accessible other conferences are to them.

Our program prioritises anyone who is part of an under-represented or marginalized group. They include, but are not limited to:

- women and other gender minorities of all expressions and identities; e.g. trans, agender and non-binary people
- people of colour
- sexuality minorities, including asexual people
- people with disabilities, whether visible and invisible
- neurodivergent people
- people with chronic illnesses or diseases
- religious and ethnic minorities
- age minorities (under ~21, over ~60)
- people experiencing poverty
- homeless and home/food-insecure people
- caregivers of children or other dependents
- people who have experienced trauma and its aftermath (PTSD, anxiety, etc)
- people living with or recovering from substance abuse

**The Grant Application is now closed.**. We are currently reviewing all applications and will inform applicants of the results within a few days. Please note that if you missed the deadline, you will need to seek alternative funding sources. Additionally, speakers are reminded that they are automatically entitled to receive a ticket.
